### Fibonacci_fun

A friend of mine recently went on an interview. It was an engineering position working with cloud technologies, unrelated to Salesforce. He was asked to write a piece of code that will generate a Fibonacci sequence while he was on that interview. <br/>
So, naturally, I thought: "if that was me, and I was asked to create something similar, how would I do that?"<br/>

I set aside an hour one Sunday morning to see how far I can take it. And here is what you are looking at. :) <br/>

To test the code, you can simply open Execute Annonymous in your console and run this command. Check your Debug Logs for results<br/>
`FibonacciUtil.createFibonacci(30);`
